# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

## Questions:

1. **Define Software Engineering:**

* _What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?_
	
	- Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end-users. In contrast, traditional programming primarily involves the act of writing code to solve specific problems, often with less emphasis on structured processes, documentation, long-term maintenance, and cross-functional teamwork.
 
2. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**

_Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase._

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software industry professionals to design, develop, and test high-quality software. Here are the various phases of the SDLC, along with brief descriptions of each:

1. **Planning:**

**Description:** This phase involves defining the project's scope, objectives, and deliverables. It includes feasibility studies, resource allocation, project scheduling, and risk management. The main goal is to establish a clear plan and roadmap for the project's execution.  

2. **Requirements Analysis:**

**Description:** During this phase, stakeholders' needs and expectations are gathered and documented in detail. Functional and non-functional requirements are identified, ensuring that the software will meet user needs and comply with business rules.



3. **Agile vs. Waterfall Models:**

_**Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?**_

4. **Requirements Engineering:**

_**What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.**_

5. **Software Design Principles:**

_**Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?**_

6. **Testing in Software Engineering:**

_**Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?**_

7. **Version Control Systems:**

_**What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.**_

8. **Software Project Management:**

_**Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?**_

9. **Software Maintenance:**

_**Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?**_

10. **Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:**

_**What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?**_

* **Submission Guidelines:**

	- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
	- Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
	- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
	- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
